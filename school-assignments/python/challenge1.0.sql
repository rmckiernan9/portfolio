-- You will find a dump of a sample database (misspellings.sql) in our

-- We will use a more extensive database on our server

-- SET @word = 'immediately';


-- Here is a very basic approach (removing double m's) that returns
-- 2 of the 6 variants in the sample database when searching for 
-- 'immediately'.

 -- Your query only needs to return the id column. Any additional 
 -- columns returned by your query will be ignored.
